 The difference between git add . and git add --all 
 both of them can track the file and make it ready for commit but the difference between them are 
 git add . is trackin file on current directory and subdirectory of the current directory while git add --all is 
 tracking all directories including root directory that means it trackes all the file and folder inside root directory

 git log --uded for to view of the commit history for repository

 
$ git log

git checkout -b branch-name to create git branch and checkout to new branch created

How git merge is work:- lets say I have two file on brach review-brach and one file on git-test branch. now when i checkout
from git-review to git-test branch it will only show one file. Then when merge git merge review-branch on my current brach
it will take file does not exist in my currenct brach and put in my current brach.
 git merget test-git (this work when i on review-brach)

git
